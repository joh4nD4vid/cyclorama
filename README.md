# Cyclorama
This add-on for Blender lets you automatically light an object in the style of a photo shoot, using three-point lighting and cyclorama. It will help you quickly create relevant presentation renderings.

## Installation
**Download the cyclorama.py file** 
Then, in Blender:
Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> Install

Browse for the file. Once installed, check the "Cyclorama" box in the list of add-ons to activate it. This may require a software restart to take effect.

## Usage
Right-click on any 3D object in your scene. Choose the "Cyclorama" option at the bottom of the menu.


### Future updates
- [ ] Ability to create and select rendering preset files
- [ ] Sliders to quickly rotate lights around the object
- [ ] Buttons to change light colors, or choose relevant color sets
